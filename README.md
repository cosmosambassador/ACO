Allied Command Intergalactic Relations — Operations Tooling Stack

Maintained by: cosmosambassador (TJ Morris / UNA AEON)










📘 Mission Objective

Toolkit-1 serves as the first official operational package for the ACIR Command architecture.
It provides a cross-platform, standards-aligned foundation for:

GitOps Deployment

Infrastructure-as-Code

ArgoCD Pipelines

GitHub Automation

CLI Execution Libraries

Symbiote-Aligned Documentation Systems

This repository acts as the central library, the Codex staging ground, and the command-deck foundation for future ACIR and UNA AEON systems.

📚 Wiki (Under Construction)

Draft Wiki structure:

Overview

GitOps Principles

ArgoCD Deployment Guide

Terraform Infrastructure Guide

Symbiote Codex Integration

Tooling Reference Library

ACIR Command Philosophy

Once you create the GitHub Wiki tab, I can populate it automatically.

🌐 ACIR Organization Page

If you want your own GitHub Organization (recommended for ACIR):

Proposed Name:
ACIR-Command or American-Communications-Online

This will provide:

A unified family of repositories

Branding consistency

GitOps multi-repo environments

Role-based access levels

I can set up the org structure, index pages, and visual identity when you’re ready.

🔧 Next Steps I Can Automate for You

You may request:

1. Complete Wiki Generation

→ I’ll populate all pages with structured documentation.

2. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipelines

→ Automated testing, linting, packaging, releases.

3. Helm Chart Boilerplates

→ For deploying ACIR services.

4. ACIR Command-Deck Webpage

→ A polished homepage for your toolkit.

5. Codex Premium Skin

→ Gold/black ACIR visual theme for all documents.

✨ Command Acknowledgment

This repository represents Phase-1 of your Codex and ACIR command structure.
Toolkit-1 is now your operational anchor — stable, expandable, and ready for future systems.
